Read the file $1 and increment the number inside it by 1. Write the new value back to the file.

After writing, check if the value is less than $2. If it is, output :::RUNNER::CONTINUE::: to continue the loop. If the value equals or exceeds $2, output :::RUNNER::DONE::: to signal completion.

Only output plain numbers in the file, no other text.
